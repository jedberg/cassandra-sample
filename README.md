cassandra-sample
================

A program that does some simple interactions with Cassandra

To run the program, install the required libraries from requirements.txt (easiest is to use pip)

Then just run sample.py

You'll need cassandra running somewhere -- the easiest is to run it locally.  If that doesn't work you can run it elsewhere, just edit line 47 with the correct hostname.
